# Learn FHIR

A beginner‑friendly, practical introduction to HL7 FHIR  
based on real‑world learning and implementation experience.

This repository focuses on **building intuition first**, before diving into
specifications, implementation guides, or compliance details.

---

## Start Here

👉 [Introduction](00-introduction.md)

This introduction covers:
- What FHIR is and why it exists
- Core concepts and terminology
- How to think about resources, APIs, and interoperability

## CMS Interoperability (Conceptual Foundation)

Once you’re comfortable with basic FHIR concepts, move on to CMS
interoperability from a **high‑level, non‑spec perspective**:

👉 [CMS Interoperability Basics](01-cms-interoperability-basics.md)  
Explains why CMS is involved in interoperability, how regulation drives
technical standards, and the core interaction patterns CMS is trying to enable.

👉 [CMS‑9115‑F: Interoperability and Patient Access](02-cms-9115f.md)  
Covers data access and exchange mandates, including patient access,
provider access, and payer‑to‑payer data sharing—without diving into
implementation details.

👉 [CMS-0057-F: Prior Authorization and Workflow Automation](03-cms-0057f.md)  
Introduces prior authorization as a workflow problem, explains why it is
different from data access, and sets the stage for understanding more
advanced workflow‑oriented standards.

## What This Repo Is (and Is Not)

- ✅ A learning‑first, beginner‑friendly guide  
- ✅ Focused on **concepts and mental models**  
- ✅ Grounded in real‑world implementation experience  

- ❌ Not an official HL7 or CMS specification  
- ❌ Not a compliance or certification checklist  
- ❌ Not an exhaustive reference for every IG

Deeper dives into specific APIs, workflows, and implementation guides
will be added **separately and incrementally**, once the fundamentals
are well understood.
