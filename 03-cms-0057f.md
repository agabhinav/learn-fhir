# CMS-0057-F: Prior Authorization and Workflow Automation

## Why Prior Authorization Is Different

Unlike patient access or data exchange, prior authorization is a
workflow problem, not just a data problem.

It involves requests, responses, decisions, and status changes over time.

Unlike CMS‑9115‑F, which focuses on making data available for retrieval,
CMS‑0057‑F focuses on automating an end‑to‑end business process.

The goal is not just access to information, but coordinated decision‑making
between providers and payers.

## What CMS-0057-F Introduces

CMS-0057-F requires payers to support electronic prior authorization
using standard APIs.

The rule aims to reduce delays, administrative burden, and manual processes.

## Required Technical Capabilities

To support automated prior authorization, systems must:
- Exchange structured requests and responses
- Support asynchronous workflows
- Use standardized clinical data

Asynchronous workflows are required because prior authorization decisions
often involve review steps that cannot be completed in a single request‑response
interaction.

## Prior Authorization API

The Prior Authorization API supports the submission and tracking
of authorization requests between providers and payers.

While it still uses FHIR and OAuth 2.0, the interaction pattern
is fundamentally different from data access APIs.

## Role of Da Vinci Implementation Guides

CMS relies heavily on the HL7 Da Vinci project for prior authorization.
Da Vinci IGs define how prior authorization requests, responses, and
supporting clinical data are represented in FHIR.

These guides exist because prior authorization requires workflow‑specific
semantics that go beyond basic data exchange.

Prior authorization highlights why CMS mandates extend beyond simple
resource retrieval APIs.
